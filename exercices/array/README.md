# Array

Contiguous area of memory with equal-size elements indexed by contiguous integers

# Complexity Analysis

## Time

Beginning, middle and end, respectively
Add | Remove 
--- | ------
O(n) | O(n)
O(n) | O(n)
O(1) | O(1)

# Summary

* Constant time to access any element
* Constant time to add and remove at the end and beginning of the array
* Linear time to add and remove at arbitrary location
